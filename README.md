# lazy-rails

A template for creating a new rails project from scratch with some defaults, such as having Guard, RSpec, and a basic api auth setup to copy.

The generated project will have a Vuetify SPA frontend with a basic landing page and login/logout bits already setup.

It appears that [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) can do lots of clever stuff, it may get added.
